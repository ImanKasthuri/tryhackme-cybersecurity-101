## 1. SIEM Lab

Today I learned about the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool. This involves gathering security-related information and events from various sources. If SIEM finds something suspicious, an alert will be generated.

What I learned,

1. First, I inspect the alert in the SIEM Dashboard. I identified the malicious IP address from the alerts and then copied it to the IP Scanner tab. From the IP Scanner tab, it was showing all the information of the Malicious IP Addresses, which includes Attribute, ISP, Domain Name, Country, and City. 

2. I escalated the event to the SOC Lead and blocked the Malicious IP address from the Firewall Block List.
